			<h1>About Mandy</h1>

			<aside>
				<img src="images/mandy.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Mandy Sims" />
			</aside>

			<p id="bio"><span>Hello and welcome!</span> I am a qualified coach and mentor, with an ILM Level 7 Certificate for Executive and Senior Level Coaches and Mentors, as well as being a qualified practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming.  I also use my years of experience as an environmental trainer and facilitator, to offer excellent <a href="#coaching">coaching</a>, <a href="#training">training</a> and <a href="#facilitation">facilitation</a> to individuals and groups in the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>

			<p>I have been working in the field of personal and professional development for 25 years, originally as a trainer, facilitator and coach at Losehill Hall, the Peak District National Park Authority’s Environmental Training Centre, and over the last 12 years have been successfully running my own business offering coaching, facilitation and training services.</p>

			<p>Prior to this, I was a co-director, writer and performer for a theatre-in-education company, and earlier still, a registered nurse.  Communicating well with all sorts of people is what my life’s work is about.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Mandy quickly got a grasp of the issues I was struggling with and listened with interest and concern. I felt understood, validated, supported, sometimes challenged and always respected. Mandy’s suggestions were insightful, helpful and effective. We also managed to have a laugh now and then.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="referee">Julie Hanson, Area Ranger, National Trust</p>
			</aside>

			<p>I am inspired by helping people to make the very best of themselves, both in their work and out of it.  What drives me is to see someone make positive changes or to discover something new about themselves that gives them greater confidence to take action.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="coaching">
			<h1>Coaching</h1>

			<p>My coaching clients want to identify and achieve personal and professional goals, and my style of coaching, which is honest, insightful, warm and sensible, helps them to do that.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I chose Mandy as a mentor as part of an Arts Council course but I found her sessions so useful and suited to my personality I engaged her after the course concluded. Mandy's coaching came at a pivotal moment in my career and has led to a really positive job move and vastly improved personal outlook and confidence. I couldn't be happier with Mandy's coaching…</p>
				</blockquote>

			</aside>

			<p>As an individual, you may be lacking direction or self-belief; you may feel overwhelmed by work or find colleagues difficult to work with; or you may just want to try out new possibilities to help fulfil your potential.</p>

			<p>As a manager, you may be looking for a coach to help improve the performance of your team members.  Some may want help with self-confidence, some with presentation at meetings and events, and others with being more effective.</p>

			<p>I offer flexible, one-to-one coaching at a time and place to suit you – this includes holding sessions remotely via video link or over the phone, if that works best for you.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>My coaching sessions with Mandy have been incredibly useful for me, and have helped to improve my self-belief and outlook both on a professional and personal level. I find Mandy so easy to talk to, effortlessly assuming the role of an old friend. She has an uncanny ability to ask the right questions that uncover real insights and always gives good advice that I return to long after the session ends.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Mandy has been a remarkable coach and mentor in the past six months as I have been dealing with organisational change and staff issues around that. Her thoughtful suggestions and guidance were always tailored to the issue at hand, and she left me space to think and explore options as part of our conversations. I have come away with a much better sense of how to engage productively and sensitively with a range of colleagues, and how to experiment with different approaches.</p>

			<h1>Training</h1>

			<p>Excellent quality training can change lives, and certainly changes the way that people work. I devise and deliver training that is always of the highest standard. Whether short workshops or longer programmes, my training…</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Starts where the learners are</li>
				<li>Taps into the learners’ preferred learning styles</li>
				<li>Pays attention to the detail</li>
				<li>Is adaptable and flexible to meet training needs that change as the training progresses</li>
			</ul>

			<p>I have many years of experience in providing training in the following areas:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Learning and development</li>
				<li>Leadership skills</li>
				<li>Effective team working</li>
			</ul>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>We have used Mandy for a couple of project workshop meetings and she has been excellent.  Her pre-planning and facilitation of an agenda that kept people engaged in the discussions and able to contribute was first class.  Mandy was able to suggest methods that suited our requirements and both sessions were valuable in moving our project forward.  I wouldn’t hesitate to use Mandy again.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Mandy as a trainer is second to none, she has a certain way of making you feel valued, inspired, relevant and competent all at the same time without ever coming across as patronising as many ‘teachers’ seem to do.  She has an in-depth background knowledge of outdoor education and shares this whilst drawing new ideas from the group and genuinely accepting and nurturing any thoughts brought forward and shared.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="referee">Tom Eyles, Senior Reserves Officer, Gwent Wildlife Trust</p>

			<h1>Facilitation</h1>

			<p>Good facilitation makes meetings, workshops and consultation events as enjoyable and effective as possible.  If you have ever come away from a meeting involving a large group of people, feeling that there was a lack of clarity, that it was hard to participate, and that it was of little benefit, then it could probably have done with some expert facilitation.</p>

			<p>I work as a facilitator for a great range of clients, and my aims are always the same: to ensure that the client’s objectives are achieved in the shortest time, with the optimum input from everyone and maximum enjoyment for all involved.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>There are few trainers as gifted or as likely to make a significant impact as Mandy.  She wields an impressive array of training techniques and styles and does so in a way that engages with all attendees from the outset. Whether on work issues, lifestyles or personal development, her approach is always warm, fresh and highly effective. It has been a delight to work with Mandy over the last six years... and I hope to continue for many more.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="referee">Dr Nick Winterbotham, Heritage and Learning consultant</p>
			</aside>

			<p>My style is inclusive, adaptable and very well organised. I ensure that all participants feel welcomed and comfortable, and fully engage in the issues and questions, confident that their voices have been listened to.</p>

			<p>I use a range of creative techniques, often devising new ones where necessary, to keep participants on track and make the best use of time.</p>

			<p>Examples of occasions when good facilitation can ensure success:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Strategic planning meetings</li>
				<li>Public consultation events</li>
				<li>Customer focus groups</li>
				<li>Visioning and innovation workshops</li>
				<li>Project or service reviews</li>
				<li>Annual General Meetings</li>
				<li>Partnership and steering group meetings</li>
			</ul>
