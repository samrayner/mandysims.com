			</aside>

			<p id="bio"><span>Hello and welcome!</span> I’m Mandy Sims, an expert in the field of personal and professional development. I use my years of experience as an environmental trainer and facilitator, as well as being a qualified practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, to offer excellent <a href="#coaching">coaching</a>, <a href="#training">training</a> and <a href="#facilitation">facilitation</a> to individuals and groups in the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>

			<p>I have been working in the field of personal and professional development for 20 years, originally as a trainer, facilitator and coach at Losehill Hall, the <a href="http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/">Peak District National Park Authority</a>’s Environmental Training Centre, and over the last 8 years have been successfully expanding my freelance business.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Mandy quickly got a grasp of the issues I was struggling with and listened with interest and concern. I felt understood, validated, supported, sometimes challenged and always respected. Mandy’s suggestions were insightful, helpful and effective. We also managed to have a laugh now and then.</p>

			<p>Prior to this, I was a co-director, writer and performer for a theatre-in-education company, and earlier still, a registered nurse.  Communicating well with all sorts of people is what my life’s work is about.</p>

			<p>I am inspired by helping people to make the very best of themselves, both in their work and out of it.  What drives me is to see someone make positive changes or to discover something new about themselves that gives them greater confidence to take action.</p>

			<h1>Coaching</h1>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I chose Mandy as a mentor as part of an Arts Council course but I found her sessions so useful and suited to my personality I engaged her after the course concluded. Mandy's coaching came at a pivotal moment in my career and has led to a really positive job move and vastly improved personal outlook and confidence. I couldn't be happier with Mandy's coaching…</p>

			<p>My coaching clients want to identify and achieve personal goals, and my style of coaching, which is honest, insightful, warm and sensible, helps them to do that.</p>

			<p>As an individual, you may be lacking direction or self-belief, you may feel overwhelmed by work, or you may want to try out new possibilities to help fulfil your potential.</p>

			<p>As a manager, you may be looking for a coach to help improve the performance of your team members.  Some may want help with self-confidence, some with presentation at meetings and events, and others with being more effective.</p>

			<p>I offer flexible, one-to-one coaching at a time and place to suit you.</p>

			<p>Recent clients include:</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>We have used Mandy for a couple of project workshop meetings and she has been excellent.  Her pre-planning and facilitation of an agenda that kept people engaged in the discussions and able to contribute was first class.  Mandy was able to suggest methods that suited our requirements and both sessions were valuable in moving our project forward.  I wouldn’t hesitate to use Mandy again.</p>

			<h1>Training</h1>

			<p>Excellent quality training can change lives, and certainly changes the way that people work. I devise and deliver training that is always of the highest standard. Whether short workshops or longer programmes, my training…</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Mandy as a trainer is second to none, she has a certain way of making you feel valued, inspired, relevant and competent all at the same time without ever coming across as patronising as many ‘teachers’ seem to do.  She has an in-depth background knowledge of outdoor education and shares this whilst drawing new ideas from the group and genuinely accepting and nurturing any thoughts brought forward and shared.</p>

			<h1>Facilitation</h1>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Mandy is a great person to work with.  She has facilitated our annual Staff Conference for the past two years, working with our Staff Conference Working Group to come up with a full and exciting programme, which engages and encourages contributions from all staff.  Her attention to detail is second to none and she instils confidence in the rest of the group.  The Conferences have been well prepared and well organised. She is a warm, thoughtful person who makes the Conference an enjoyable event for all staff with a positive outcome for everyone.</p>

			</aside>

			<p>Good facilitation makes meetings, workshops and consultation events as enjoyable and effective as possible.  If you have ever come away from a meeting involving a large group of people, feeling that there was a lack of clarity, that it was hard to participate, and that it was of little benefit, then it could probably have done with some expert facilitation.</p>

			<p>I work as a facilitator for a great range of clients, and my aims are always the same: to ensure that the client’s objectives are achieved in the shortest time, with the optimum input from everyone and maximum enjoyment for all involved.</p>

			<p>My style is inclusive, adaptable and very well organised. I ensure that all participants feel welcomed and comfortable, and fully engage in the issues and questions, confident that their voices have been listened to.</p>

			<p>I use a range of creative techniques, often devising new ones where necessary, to keep participants on track and make the best use of time.</p>

			<p>Examples of occasions when good facilitation can ensure success:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Strategic planning meetings</li>
				<li>Public consultation events</li>
				<li>Customer focus groups</li>
				<li>Visioning and innovation workshops</li>
				<li>Project or service reviews</li>
				<li>Annual General Meetings</li>
				<li>Partnership and steering group meetings</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Recent clients include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency">Environment Agency</a> – meetings of the Trent Gateway Steering Group to move the programme forward from vision to delivery</li>
