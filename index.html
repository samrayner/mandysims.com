			<h1>About Mandy</h1>

			<aside>
				<img src="images/mandy.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Mandy Sims" />
			</aside>

			<p id="bio"><span>Hello and welcome!</span> I’m Mandy Sims, an expert in the field of personal and professional development. I use my years of experience as an environmental trainer and facilitator, as well as being a qualified practitioner of Neuro-Linguistic Programming, to offer excellent <a href="#coaching">coaching</a>, <a href="#training">training</a> and <a href="#facilitation">facilitation</a> to individuals and groups in the public, private and voluntary sectors.</p>

			<p>I have been working in the field of personal and professional development for 15 years, originally as a trainer, facilitator and coach at Losehill Hall, the <a href="http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/">Peak District National Park Authority</a>’s Environmental Training Centre, and over the last 3 years have been successfully expanding my freelance business.</p>

			<p>Prior to this, I was a co-director, writer and performer for a theatre-in-education company, and earlier still, a registered nurse.  Communicating well with all sorts of people is what my life’s work is about.</p>

			<p>I am inspired by helping people to make the very best of themselves, both in their work and out of it.  What drives me is to see someone make positive changes or to discover something new about themselves that gives them greater confidence to take action.</p>

			<h1>Coaching</h1>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I have enjoyed and benefited from having Mandy as a coach, and I can see the day-to-day difference this has made.  She is a respectful listener, who asks the right questions – sometimes challenging, always helpful.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="referee">Early Years professional lecturer/tutor</p>
			</aside>

			<p>My coaching clients want to identify and achieve personal goals, and my style of coaching, which is honest, insightful, warm and sensible, helps them to do that.</p>

			<p>As an individual, you may be lacking direction or self-belief, you may feel overwhelmed by work, or you may want to try out new possibilities to help fulfil your potential.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Did I say it was the best course I’ve ever been on? But, more than that, I really think I will use in my job so much of what I have learned. I’m genuinely inspired.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="referee">Environmental Learning Officer, <a href="http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk/">National Park Authority</a></p>
			</aside>

			<p>As a manager, you may be looking for a coach to help improve the performance of your team members.  Some may want help with self-confidence, some with presentation at meetings and events, and others with being more effective.</p>

			<p>I offer flexible, one-to-one coaching at a time and place to suit you.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>A rare thing – a warm and human approach that achieves tangible results. I used Mandy’s services through a period of change and transition to a new role. I gained a real understanding of my own potential, so I started my new role able to set goals to match my strengths. A benefit for me, as it made the career move a success and for my new organisation as I was able to make the contribution I wanted to right from the start.</p>

		<section id="facilitation">
			<h1>Facilitation</h1>

			<p>Good facilitation makes meetings, workshops and consultation events as enjoyable and effective as possible.  If you have ever come away from a meeting involving a large group of people, feeling that there was a lack of clarity, that it was hard to participate, and that it was of little benefit, then it could probably have done with some expert facilitation.</p>

			<p>I work as a facilitator for a great range of clients, and my aims are always the same: to ensure that the client’s objectives are achieved in the shortest time, with the optimum input from everyone and maximum enjoyment for all involved.</p>

			<aside>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Mandy was very thorough with the preparation for the meeting. Agendas and preparation were carefully thought about. The meeting itself ran smoothly in a very co-operative atmosphere with everyone engaged and contributing. As such the results were just what we were looking for.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="referee">Philip Broadbent-Yale, Getting Outdoors and Closer to Nature Programme Manager, <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/">National Trust</a></p>
			</aside>

			<p>My style is inclusive, adaptable and very well organised. I ensure that all participants feel welcomed and comfortable, and fully engage in the issues and questions, confident that their voices have been listened to.</p>

			<p>I use a range of creative techniques, often devising new ones where necessary, to keep participants on track and make the best use of time.</p>

			<p>Examples of occasions when good facilitation can ensure success:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Strategic planning meetings</li>
				<li>Public consultation events</li>
				<li>Customer focus groups</li>
				<li>Visioning and innovation workshops</li>
				<li>Project or service reviews</li>
				<li>Annual General Meetings</li>
